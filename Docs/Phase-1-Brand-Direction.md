# MindSense Phase 1 Brand Direction

## Target Vibe (5 Words)
- warm
- sleek
- intelligent
- calm
- premium

## Visual North Star Board (3 References Max)
1. Apple Health (card hierarchy and trust-first spacing)
2. Aesop digital product pages (premium warmth through restrained color + serif pairing)
3. Stripe Dashboard (intelligent data framing with clean, high-confidence structure)

## Locked Style Rules
- Palette: keep cool-neutrals as base; add soft-warm accents only through highlights and key actions.
- Contrast: preserve accessibility-first contrast; premium tone cannot reduce readability.
- Surfaces: use layered cards with subtle stroke/shadow, never heavy glassmorphism or neon effects.
- Typography: prioritize clarity with controlled personality; use weight and spacing to signal hierarchy, not oversized UI chrome.
- Motion: calm and purposeful; short ease-out transitions, no playful bounce.
- Information density: concise and signal-led; each screen should present one primary action path.
- Iconography: minimal, rounded, and consistent stroke weight.
- Copy voice: calm, factual, and supportive with confidence qualifiers where relevant.
- Composition: generous whitespace and stable alignment grid; avoid crowded stacks.
- Visual consistency: all new screens must map to this direction before implementation.

## Product Promise (Locked for v1)
- Primary promise: In under 30 seconds, the user sees current state and one recommended next action.
- First-screen success metric: user can identify one clear next action without scrolling.

## v1 Scope Lock
- In scope: `Today`, `Regulate`, `Data`, `Settings`.
- Hidden behind debug/demo flag in production: `Community`, `KPI scorecard`, scenario switching, guided demo controls.

## Phase 1 Brief Update
- Replace previous tone adjectives (`clinical`, `focused`, `precise`) with:
  - `warm`
  - `sleek`
  - `intelligent`
  - `calm`
  - `premium`
